# Network Dynamics (ND)

The **Network Dynamics (ND)** is a formal framework for studying how agency, autonomy, and cooperation emerge within interacting systems of nodes. It provides mathematical definitions,
natural-language exposition, and pseudocode, to make the framework accessible for both implementation and interpretation.

My work is a seed, small in form, but immense in potential. 
Inside it lies the challenge to reveal principles that could reshape how we understand complexity itself. 
By uniting autonomy, cooperation, and emergent order under one generative calculus, it invites researchers to push beyond existing models and explore the next frontier of science.
