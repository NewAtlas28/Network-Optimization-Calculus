# Network Optimization Calculus (NOC)

The **Network Optimization Calculus (NOC)** is a formal framework for studying how agency, autonomy, and cooperation emerge within interacting systems of nodes. It provides mathematical definitions,
natural-language exposition, pseudocode, and a GPT, to make the framework accessible for both implementation and interpretation.

## Core Ideas

- **Nodes**: Each node has a type, intrinsic value, and intensity.  
- **Relationships**: Cohesive, Neutral, or Disjunctive.  
- **Value Realization**: Only cohesive ties generate realized value.  
- **Optimization Target**: Balances exploitation of realized value vs. exploration of latent value.  
- **Transition Dynamics**: Relationships evolve probabilistically & deterministically.  
- **Autonomy**: Emerges recursively as the systemâ€™s own feedback loop of adaptation.  
- **Cooperation with Natural Laws**: Defined by how much realized value dominates latent value.
