# Network Optimization Calculus (NOC)

The **Network Optimization Calculus (NOC)** is a formal framework for studying how agency, autonomy, and cooperation emerge within interacting systems of nodes. It provides mathematical definitions,
natural-language exposition, and pseudocode, to make the framework accessible for both implementation and interpretation.

**"If water (NOC), is going to be useful, it requires healthy minerals. These minerals, are plug-ins based on domain context."**

## Core Ideas

- **Nodes**: Each node has a type, intrinsic value, and intensity.  
- **Relationships**: Cohesive, Neutral, or Disjunctive.  
- **Value Realization**: Only cohesive ties generate realized value.  
- **Optimization Target**: Balances exploitation of realized value vs. exploration of latent value.  
- **Transition Dynamics**: Relationships evolve probabilistically & deterministically.  
- **Autonomy**: Emerges recursively as the systemâ€™s own feedback loop of adaptation.  
- **Cooperation with Natural Laws**: Defined by how much realized value dominates latent value.

My work is a seed, small in form, but immense in potential. 
Inside it lies the challenge to reveal principles that could reshape how we understand complexity itself. 
By uniting autonomy, cooperation, and emergent order under one generative calculus, it invites researchers to push beyond existing models and explore the next frontier of science.
